This file contains bugs and/or weird behaviours spotted and pending to be fixed.

Dungeon.py

  Map generation:   
    Leaves one D in one of the rooms (Pending fix that and remove code that removes Ds)
    Generator is predictable (Multiple south rooms connected to a north one)
    Cthulhu algorithm needs more randomness. Missing tentacles and wings.
    Entrance and exit tiles are too close together

  Minimap/advmap: 
    Doesn't have minimum size (Sanitize input pending)
    Stupid out of range errors (Fucking lists, how do they work?)

mob.py

player.py
  Movement:         
    When moving more than 1 tile, a position out of the map can be hit (Out of range) 
    When moving one tile, an out of range error can happen if the last position is empty (.)
    If SPD is over 10 and the player moves more than 1 tile, it may be impossible to place the player marker in the exit tile (Solved (?) by making everything turn-based or turn-dependant)

launch.py 
  crawl:
    'int' object not callable when assigning global variables, generator size input depending on integer input not to crash
