This file contains bugs and/or weird behaviours spotted and pending to be fixed. 

Dungeon.py

  Map generation:   
    Leaves one D in one of the rooms (Pending fix that and remove code that removes Ds)
    Generator is predictable (Multiple south rooms connected to a north one)
    Cthulhu algorithm needs more randomness.
    Entrance and exit tiles are too close together in big dungeons
    Dungeon array not closed on the borders

  Minimap/advmap: 
    Doesn't have minimum size (Sanitize input pending on generator to avoid infinite loops)
    Stupid out of range errors (Fucking lists, how do they work?)

mob.py

player.py
  Movement:         
    Issues when SPD is too high (Solved with turns in the future, movement always 1 as temporary fix)
    wars/wasd keys do not work when moving
  Inventory management issues
    2H weapons don't unequip 1h weapons.
    can't dual-wield 1h weapons.

launch.py 
  crawl:
    'int' object not callable when assigning global variables, generator size input depending on integer input not to crash

item.py
  Items in inventory and equip are conserved between games (play->exit->play)
  item names contain extra spaces
